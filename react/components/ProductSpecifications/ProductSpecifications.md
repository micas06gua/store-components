## Usage

You should follow the usage instruction in the main [README](/README.md#usage).

Then, add `product-specifications` block into your app theme, as we do in our [Product Details app](https://github.com/vtex-apps/product-details/blob/master/store/blocks.json). 

### Blocks API

When implementing this component as a block, various inner blocks may be available. The following interface lists the available blocks within `ProductSpecifications` and describes if they are required or optional.

 ```json
  "product-specifications":{
    "component": "ProductSpecifications"
  }
```	

For now this block does not have any required or optional blocks.

### Configuration

Through the Storefront, you can change the `ProductSpecifications`'s behavior and interface. However, you also can make in your theme app, as Store theme does.
